# DEFCON.run
Hello World! I present to you: the full Infastructure as Code and Front-end repository for the https://app.defcon.run site for DefCon 32 2024.

For last decade defcon.run (aka defcon4x5) has been evolving to the annual premiere hacker community running event. ðŸ¤¡ It has gone from loose associations to a formalized DefCon event. Along the way many new things have been tried - including this site/app.

# What am I looking at?
This is a modern full-stack webapp built using `Nx + terraform + Next.js + Next-UI + Auth.js + Strapi`. I have a long history of writing code - and this is kind of an amalgamation of my techniques and approach. It was done adhoc, during my 'spare time' over 4 months between April and August 2024. I started not knowing SO MUCH and learned a tonne along the way.

FOR SURE there are a tonne of wrinkles, unfinished bits, half-baked features, etc. etc. Overall I am proud of this work. :-)

### AWS, Strapi, Nx and Next.js Eco-systems

I used terraform to standup the AWS infrastructure for the site. The only exception is the AWS SES setup which I did manually/clickops. Otherwise, it's a `tf apply` and `tf destroy` to bring all the AWS certs, lb  and cluster resources up/down. Early on I would destroy the infra everyday and bring it back to work on.

I used `Nx` as my build system - it's an awesome way to manage a mono-repo like this one.

I also deployed a pre-built Strapi application to our ECS as Docker image. Our `Next.js` application makes calls to Strapi to get the site content like routes and FAQ. Local development was super easy - just running a Strapi image locally and pointing the locally running Next.js to that. I also run a DynamoDB in a Docker image for local dev.

## AWS Architecture
The diagram shows two entries into the system - LB or CloudFront. Only requests for `assets.cms.defon.run` (aka S3 bucket) are currently fronted all others goto the load balancer. In the future, all traffic will flow through a CloudFront distribution.

## Modern Responsive Design w/ Ligh+Dark+Custom Theming
We used Next.js, Next-UI and Auth.js (ie. NextAuth.js) for a modern look and feel. These frameworks made dark/light/custom themeing easy. Using the Next-UI provided all of the major components necessary.

The site looks great on laptops, phones and tablets - it's fully responsive. It also has a lot of hooks for accessible design - aria, etc.

### Strapi CMS
We used a headless Strapi CMS implementation to store static and homesite related data.

## Interactive Map
Using the Leaflet Toolkit I was able to take the GPX files from our past runs and make an interactive map.
